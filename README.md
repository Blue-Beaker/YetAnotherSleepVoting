## Yet Another Sleep Voting Mod
Simple server-side sleep voting mod.  
Only redirects the vanilla "All players sleeping" check with mixin, so the night/thunder skipping behaviour is as same as vanilla.  
Configuration is in `config/yasleepvoting.cfg`:  
- sleepVotePercentage: Sleep Voting Percentage. When (sleeping players / non-spectator players)>this value, the night/thunder will be skipped.
